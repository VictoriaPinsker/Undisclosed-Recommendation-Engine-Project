Product recommendation engines have the potential to alter the way websites connect with retailers and end users, provide customers with a refined user experience, and maximize their return on the investment driven by the information they can gain on customers’ personal preferences and purchases. By using advanced algorithms such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to full advantage, a recommendation system can assist with showing customers the relevant products they want or need. 

The goal of this project was to leverage a network association model and a latent factor model, via python, to construct a customized recommendation engine that provides a range of diversified top 10 products to end-users. This recommendation engine produces recommendations in real time that are personalized to users and also beneficial to the company's business development. We predict this accurate information will not only increase customer loyalty and engagement but also increase Ingram Micro’s total sales and profits. More specifically, we believe our recommendation engine will help with customers’ decision making and increase the company's average carted value.

We have also developed ways to test the engine’s accuracy. They provide us with an initial glance at its performance. However, additional testing strategies could also be further developed to monitor the performance based on other metrics and business implications, should they change in the future.
